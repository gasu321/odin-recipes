    <h3>Classic mashed potatoes with a twist</h3>
    <p>The leeks add a very mild oniony flavor for a little something different from the classic mashed potatoes.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 leek, white parts only, quartered lengthwise and finely sliced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon coarse salt</li>
        <li>water to cover</li>
        <li>⅓ cup milk, warmed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine potatoes, leek, and salt in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot). 
            Add water to cover, about 2 cups. Close and lock the lid. 
            Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes.
            Allow about 10 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Carefully release remaining pressure using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Drain potatoes well and return them to the pot.</li>
        <li>Select Saute function. Toss potatoes until dried and starting to sizzle, about 3 minutes. Add butter; stir until melted. Add milk. Mash potatoes with the back of a wooden spoon for a rustic mash, or run them through a ricer for a smoother mash. Taste and adjust the salt.</li>
